## ⚡️ Features

- ***Add and remove bookmarks  :*** (folders & files) with a single click or keyboard shortcut
- ***Lightning-fast navigation  :*** Instantly open, focus, or reveal any bookmarked path
- ***Non-destructive  :*** Removing a bookmark never deletes or moves files — only your sidebar bookmarks change
- ***Session persistence  :*** Your bookmarks are saved automatically and restored across VS Code restarts (by default)
- ***Bulk management  :*** Quickly reset or clear all bookmarks in a single action
- ***Zero scroll  :*** Perfect for giant repos, monorepos, or rapid project switching

## 💡 Tips

- To avoid shortcut conflicts with VS Code or other extensions
- SIMPLE-BOOKMARK’s shortcuts are context-aware and only active when the sidebar is visible.
- Check your keybindings: `"when": "view.SIMPLE-BOOKMARK.visible"`

## 🚧 Roadmap

- Add filter/ignore rules by extension or filename pattern
- Multi-select and bulk operations
- Drag-and-drop reordering
- Smart context actions (move/copy/open-in-terminal)
- More keyboard shortcuts (configurable)

## 🛠️ Under the Hood

- Built for maximum speed, clarity, and zero risk
- Designed for large teams, polyrepo, monorepo, or any developer who hates scrolling
